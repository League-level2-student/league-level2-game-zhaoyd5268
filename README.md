Hi. If you are here to see how to download, NICEEEEE. This game may be disturbingly hard to some, so dont rage at me. I will be sad. Link is down below, and please have fun. Import it into any IDE if you want to make changes, but credit me. Also, just paste it into your browser like chrome. It works fine too.
